The code examples used in a talk about LPeg.

date1.lua

	Very basic LPeg code to validate a string as a date in a particular
	format.

date2.lua

	A bit more complex example of LPeg that still validates a string
	as a date, but with more validation (hours are between 0 and 23,
	day of the month as a value between 1 and 31, etc).

date3.lua

	Similar to date2.lua, but this time we actually capture the data
	and return a table similar to what os.date() will return.  This
	shows how to capture data instead of just matching a string.

strftime.lua

	A complex example where LPeg is used to parse a format string
	for strftime() and return a new LPeg expression that can be used
	to parse a date printed by that format string.  This is about as
	simple an example of a DSL as you can get.

test.lua

	A program to test strftime.lua.

email-addr.lua

	Validate email addresses per the RFC-822 spec (including
	comments).  Replaces one very large and infamous regex that
	claims to validate email address (but doesn't handle comments).
